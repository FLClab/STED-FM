# Python Server Project

This project is a simple Python server that receives data, processes it, and sends back the results. It is structured to separate concerns into different modules for better maintainability and readability.

## Project Structure

```
python-server-project
├── src
│   ├── main.py               # Entry point of the application
│   ├── handlers
│   │   └── data_handler.py   # Handles incoming data requests
│   ├── services
│   │   └── processing_service.py # Contains data processing logic
│   └── utils
│       └── helpers.py        # Utility functions for various tasks
├── requirements.txt          # Project dependencies
└── README.md                 # Project documentation
```

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd python-server-project
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the server:
   ```
   python src/main.py
   ```

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can send data to it via HTTP requests. The server will process the data and return the results.

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/process-data -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"data": "your_data_here"}'
```

### Example Response

```json
{
  "result": "processed_data_here"
}
```

## Functionality

- **Data Handling**: The `DataHandler` class in `src/handlers/data_handler.py` manages incoming requests and prepares data for processing.
- **Data Processing**: The `ProcessingService` class in `src/services/processing_service.py` contains the logic for transforming and computing results based on the input data.
- **Utilities**: The `helpers.py` file in `src/utils` provides utility functions for tasks such as data validation and formatting.
